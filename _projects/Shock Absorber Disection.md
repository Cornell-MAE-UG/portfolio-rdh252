This project was completed for my System Dynamics class and focused on modeling a real shock absorber using fundamental system dynamics tools. The physical system was idealized as a second-order spring–mass–damper system, and its motion was described using a second-order ordinary differential equation that captures the relationship between mass, damping, stiffness, and external forcing. From this equation, a transfer function was derived to relate the road input to the shock absorber’s displacement. This transfer function was then used to analyze key dynamic characteristics such as system stability, damping behavior, pole locations, natural frequency, and settling time, providing insight into how the system responds to disturbances and returns to equilibrium.

I was responsible for developing the second-order ODE and transfer function models and using them to perform the system dynamics analysis and interpret the physical meaning of the results.
