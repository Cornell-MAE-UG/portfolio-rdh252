This project was completed for my Mechanics of Engineering Materials course and focuses on applying bending, stress, strain, and material selection concepts to the design of a torque-measuring beam. The overall assignment required creating an analytical model, evaluating different materials, optimizing the beam geometry, and validating the final design with a finite element analysis. Part I began with a baseline torque wrench model made from M42 steel to examine its elastic behavior and identify limitations in strength, stiffness, and strain output. Part II expanded the analysis by using MATLAB code to search a wide range of dimensions and materials to find the optimal design parameters for maximum strain while maintaining safe stress levels. The final optimized torque wrench was then analyzed through FEM to confirm the stress and strain distributions and verify that the design met all structural and measurement requirements.
