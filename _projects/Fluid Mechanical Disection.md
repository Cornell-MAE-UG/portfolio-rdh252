For my Fluid Mechanics class, my group and I disassembled a two-stroke, single-cylinder chainsaw engine to understand how its major components function from a fluid-mechanical perspective. We focused on the carburetor, piston–cylinder assembly, and magnetic flywheel because each highlights a different aspect of internal fluid behavior. The carburetor gave us a direct way to study venturi flow, pressure differences, and fuel–air mixing within a small-scale device. The piston and cylinder let us observe how internal gas motion and pressure variations develop throughout the engine cycle. The magnetic flywheel helped us connect rotational motion to the movement of air and changes in pressure around the ignition system, completing the picture of how fluid mechanics governs engine operation.
