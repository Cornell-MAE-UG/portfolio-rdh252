For my Fluid Mechanics class, my group and I disassembled a two-stroke, single-cylinder chainsaw engine to study how its major components operate from a fluid-mechanical perspective. We focused on the carburetor, piston–cylinder assembly, and magnetic flywheel, since each component demonstrates a different fluid behavior relevant to engine operation. The carburetor illustrates internal flow acceleration and mixing, the piston–cylinder assembly shows how pressure and velocity evolve throughout the engine cycle, and the magnetic flywheel connects rotational motion to pressure and airflow changes associated with ignition. Together, these components provided a complete view of how fluid mechanics governs air, fuel, and energy transfer in a small internal combustion engine.

I was specifically responsible for the carburetor analysis. Using the observed carburetor geometry (venturi), I showed how conservation of mass and Bernoulli’s equation drove velocity changes between the inlet and throat, demonstrating how the resulting pressure drop drives fuel injection. I verified the applicability of Bernoulli’s assumptions by estimating Mach number and Reynolds number, showing that the flow remained incompressible and high-Reynolds-number under operating conditions. I then related the calculated pressure drop to air mass flow rate, fuel flow through the jet, and the resulting air-fuel ratio, directly linking carburetor fluid mechanics to engine performance.
