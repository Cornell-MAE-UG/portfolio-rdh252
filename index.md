## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University with a passion for designing efficient systems and improving complex manufacturing processes. During my time at GE Aerospace, I created PCB masking templates and SolidWorks fixtures that saved hundreds of labor hours, enhanced workstation ergonomics, and reduced non-conformances in the PCB assembly cell. I thrive in hands-on engineering environments where I can pair CAD modeling, structured testing, and data analysis to deliver measurable results. My project experience—from developing automatic mechanical systems to leading iterative prototype improvements—reflects my ability to balance creativity with disciplined engineering methods. Outside of technical work, I serve as Chapter President of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc., where I manage teams, oversee budgets, and lead community-focused initiatives. I also hold leadership roles in NSBE and the Multi-Cultural Greek Fraternal Council, strengthening mentorship pipelines and expanding collaboration across campus organizations. I bring a blend of engineering rigor, problem-solving, and people-centered leadership, and I’m driven to create solutions that make an impact.
